# CV_Assignment — Pickleball Serve Analyser using Computer Vision 🎾🤖

### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses a **pickleball serve video** using Computer Vision to give **athlete-style technique feedback**.

It detects key body joints, computes angles (knee, elbow, trunk tilt), and provides coaching suggestions — similar to sports analytics tools.

Pose estimation (MediaPipe)  
Video processing (OpenCV)  
Streamlit web app  
Annotated output video  
Biomechanics-based feedback
